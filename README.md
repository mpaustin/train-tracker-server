Train Tracker

This app was created to help me track my workouts.  Previously I had just used a Google Sheets spreadsheet, but why let Google have all the fun.

To run locally:  
git clone https://github.com/mpaustin/train-tracker.git  
cd train-tracker  
npm run start

You'll need to provide your own PostgreSQL DB connection via configuration in a .env file at the root of the directory.
See https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv for details.

Feel free to play around and let me know what you think at mpaustin13@gmail.com or submit a PR at https://github.com/mpaustin/train-tracker.
