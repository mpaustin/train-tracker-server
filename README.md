Train Tracker Server

Server for Train Tracker

This app was created to help me track my workouts.  Previously I had just used a Google Sheets spreadsheet, but why let Google have all the fun.
 
git clone https://github.com/mpaustin/train-tracker-server.git  
cd train-tracker-server  
npm run start

You'll need to provide your own PostgreSQL DB connection via configuration in a .env file at the root of the directory.
See https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv for details.
